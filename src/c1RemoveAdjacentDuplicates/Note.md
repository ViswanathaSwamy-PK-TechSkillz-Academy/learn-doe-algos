# Explanation

> 1. Stack Initialization: We initialize an empty stack of rune type to store characters.
> 1. Iterate Through the String: For each character in the string, we check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is equal to the current character.
> 1. Pop Operation: If the top of the stack is the same as the current character, we remove the top element from the stack (i.e., pop operation).
> 1. Push Operation: If the top of the stack is different from the current character, we push the current character onto the stack.
> 1. Return Result: Finally, we convert the stack back to a string and return it
